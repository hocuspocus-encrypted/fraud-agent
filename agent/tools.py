"""
Each tool is a plain Python function plus a JSON schema describing it
to the model. Keep tools narrow and single-purpose -- an agent is only
as good as the clarity of the tools you hand it.

When you wire this into your real fraud pipeline, only the function
bodies change (swap sqlite3 for your Postgres connection). The schemas
and the orchestrator loop stay the same.

# This shape (name, description, parameters) is deliberately NOT tied to
# either Anthropic's or Gemini's exact wire format. Each adapter in
# adapters/ reshapes this into whatever its API expects:
#   - Anthropic wants: {"name", "description", "input_schema"}
#   - Gemini wants:    {"type": "function", "name", "description", "parameters"}
# The tool logic below (the actual functions) never changes when you
# swap providers -- only the adapter's reshaping does.
