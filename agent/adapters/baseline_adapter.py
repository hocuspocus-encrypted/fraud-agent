"""
Rule-based baseline: no LLM, just a hand-tuned scoring function over the
SAME four tools the agents use.

Why this exists: "the agent got 13/15" means nothing without a point of
comparison. If a dozen if-statements score the same as the LLM, the
LLM is adding cost and latency but not value -- and you want to know
that before an interviewer asks. It also lets you test the eval
harness offline for free (MODEL_PROVIDER=baseline).

The rules are intentionally simple and a little naive. Where they fail
(e.g. they can't tell that 'Online' is not a city, or that a 2am
purchase is normal for a night-shift worker) is where an LLM should
be able to earn its keep.
